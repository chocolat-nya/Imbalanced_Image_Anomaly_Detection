# What's for

Anomaly detection of images. It works even if NG image number is too small compared with OK image number.

# Usage

throw away .gitignore files in image/ok/ & image/ng/

put ok images in images/ok/

put ng images in images/ng/

python arcface_efficientnet.py



# Option

When you want to change train & test rate, in arcface_efficient.py change numbers of ok_test_rate & ng_test_rate.

Change model_number 0-7 to choose which efficientnet to use.
